# vagrant-archlinuxarm-rpi-img

Automates the process of generating `*.img` files from Arch Linux ARM's tarballs
for Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi 3. These can then be used
directly with `dd` on OSX and
[Win32DiskImager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) on Windows.
